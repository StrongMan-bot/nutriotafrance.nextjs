      "title": "Very good supplement in a practical small format",
      "quote": "My boyfriend regularly uses chromium in the form of picolinate, and this product suits him very well. The concentration is correct (250 mcg), the format is compact and allows for a long-term treatment, with only one tablet per day. The tablets are easy to swallow and the bottle doesn't take up space. Ideal for those looking to supplement their chromium intake in a vegan format. Very good value for money."
