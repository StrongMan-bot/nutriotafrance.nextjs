    "intro": "What if I told you that the fountain of youth isn't hidden in some expensive cream, but buried deep in the mountains? Two ancient powerhouses—silica and shilajit—are making a massive comeback, and for good reason.",
    "socialMediaScene": "Picture this: You're scrolling through social media and see someone with that impossible glow—perfect skin, thick hair, and nails that look professionally done. Your first thought? \"Good genes.\" Your second? \"Expensive treatments.\" But what if I told you the real secret might be two minerals that cost less than your monthly coffee habit?",
    "beautyIndustrySecret": "The Beauty Industry's Best-Kept Secret",
    "beautyIndustrySecretText": "Here's something the $500 billion beauty industry doesn't want you to know: Most skin problems aren't fixed from the outside. They start on the inside. While you're spending hundreds on creams that sit on your skin's surface, your body is literally starving for the building blocks it needs to create beauty from within.",
    "enterSilicaShilajit": "Enter silica and shilajit—two ancient remedies that work where it actually counts: at the cellular level.",
    "silicaSection": "Silica: Your Hair's Best Friend (And Your Skin's Too!)",
    "silicaIntro": "Ever wonder why some people have that effortless glow and thick, shiny hair that looks like it belongs in a shampoo commercial? The secret might be silica—a mineral that's like scaffolding for your beauty.",

    "silicaConstructionWorker": "Think of silica as your body's construction worker. It builds collagen—that springy stuff that keeps your skin plump and your hair thick. Without enough silica, your body can't make quality collagen. It's like trying to build a house without proper tools.",
    "silicaAging": "But here's where it gets interesting: As you age, your body's silica levels naturally drop. By age 40, you have about half the silica you had at 20. No wonder everything starts feeling... different.",

    "scienceIntro": "Here's what researchers are discovering about this ancient remedy:",
